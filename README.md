<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A small project of me making a typing test to review Python and practice my documentation skills.



### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You will need `Python 3` (preferably latest stable version), `datetime` and `pathlib` library to run this program.

### Prerequisites and Installation

Download and install Python 3.
* Python 3
  ```sh
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  ```
Dependencies.
* Install from `requirements.txt`
  ```sh
  pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Manually install `datetime`
  ```sh
  pip install datetime
  ```
* Manually install `pathlib`
  ```sh
  pip install pathlib
  ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Run main.py to use the program
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

1. User can import custom test by placing a .txt file inside `textSample` folder.
2. User can see recorded score inside `record/record.txt` if choose to.
3. Since this program is terminal based and because of the way I built it, text won't be show as you
typing but they are being record so don't worry.
